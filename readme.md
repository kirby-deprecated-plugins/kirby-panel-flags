# Kirby Panel Flags

*Version 0.1*

In a multi language installation of the panel, the language code shows the current language. Because there is no visual element (only letters) it can be easy to accidentally save the content in the wrong language.

**This plugin adds flags as a complement to the language code.**

## Setup

### 1. Blueprint

To make it work as expected, add the following code to your blueprint:

```
fields:
  flags:
    type: flags
```

## Options

This option can be set in your `/site/config/config.php` file:

```php
c::set('plugin.flags.filenames', array(
  'en' => 'gb'
));
```

### filenames

If the language code does not match the filename, you can use this option.

- The key `en` in the example is the language code.
- The value `gb` in this example is the filename without extension.

**For a full list of filenames, look here:**

Because `en` is really common and does not exist as filename it defaults to `gb`.
